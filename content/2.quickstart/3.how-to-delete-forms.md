Sometimes, you may want to delete your forms if you no longer need them or if they were created by mistake. On HeyForm, you can easily move your forms to the trash or delete them permanently.

Go to your HeyForm dashboard, choose a form and click the three dots to select <code>Delete</code>.

<img
  src="/images/delete-form-dropdown.png"
  alt="Delete form"
/>

Once you click <code>Delete</code>, your form will be sent to the trash:

<img
  src="/images/form-trash.png"
  alt="Form trash"
/>


You can restore your forms from the trash in 30 days or delete them permanently without waiting:

<img
  src="/images/form-trash-dropdown.png"
  alt="Form trash"
/>

::alert{type="danger" icon="lucide:triangle-alert"}
  All forms in the trash will be deleted permanently in 30 days!
