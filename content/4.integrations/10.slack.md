Slack is primarily used for communication in teams, as the service can be perfectly integrated into the workflow. Slack does not reinvent the wheel, but it combines many practical features from other services in one package and is extremely compatible with external programs. This mix proves to be very useful and should pave the way for further growth. With Slack you will get notified for every HeyForm completion. Slack also brings all your team members' communication and collaboration into one place, in which you will have better team productivity and efficiency.
